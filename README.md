Introduction of the Project:
  This project is mainly developed to control the laptop screen easily just by using Hand gestures. There may be various electronic devices available to control the screen like mouse, keyboard, electronic devices, etc. But they all require some practising and cost to afford them and they may also throw into repair sometimes this project comes into handy in such situations. This project is developed using mainly Computer Vision and Media Pipe.
